# Bank Loan Portfolio Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to provide insights into the bank's loan portfolio performance, assess credit risk, and optimize lending strategies. By leveraging SQL queries, we extract and process loan data from the bank's databases. This data is then visualized and analyzed in Power BI dashboards, offering a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators and metrics critical for informed decision-making.
